i'm doing the work on a jetstream instance on the jpl allocation

ssh mike@149.165.174.197  (jpl2024 if needed, but i have a key set up from my person comp)

- focusing on the arctic samples, dropping those super close to land (arbitrarily) and those indicated as "MIX" or "ZZZ"
- so keeping SRF, DCM, and MES
- ones to drop are in PRJEB9740-not-wanted-biosamples.txt
- ones wanted are in PRJEB9740-wanted-biosamples.txt


- download running on server - DONE
- MG workflow kicked off Saturday, 27-Apr

    - something caused things to crash on monday, 29-Apr
        - i think it was related to the boot/root drive getting filled, maybe by temp stuff
        - i lost access to the shared drive on that instance, when i launched another instance I was able to restart the workflow
        
        NOW ON: mike@149.165.168.116
        

- also started the sra-download workflow on the belly
